- [ ] Add quote moderation commands
  - [x] `/quote delete` (soft delete, permissions enforced)
  - [x] `/quote restore`
  - [ ] Role-based configuration/perms (beyond initial ManageMessages check)
  - [x] Hide deleted quotes in lookups/search
- [x] Create MongoDB indexes for quote queries (`ShortId`, `PersonKey`, `Tags`, soft-delete indicator)
- [ ] Improve UX with embeds and buttons for `/quote find` (display tags, mentions, like/resurface actions)
- [ ] Bootstrap `fusion.runner.Tests` with coverage for quote helpers and repository logic
- [ ] Add Dockerfile / CI workflow for build + test automation
